# Test settings
# The following flag is used to give better control of the transient storage
# state between transactions in tests. With this flag enabled, each call in a
# test function is executed as an independent transaction (normally, a test
# would be a single transaction). This means that transient storage is cleared
# after every call in a test function. See also:
