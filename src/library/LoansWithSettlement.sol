///
/// struct Data {
///     Loan.Data[] loans;
///     bytes settlement;
/// }
///
/// The encoding of the bytes array for n loans is as follows:
///
/// Content: |-- number of loans, n --||-- ABI-encoded settlement --||-- n-th Loan  --||-- (n-1)-th Loan --|...|-- 1-st Loan  --|
/// Length:  |<--     32 bytes     -->||<--    arbitrary size    -->||<--size(Loan)-->||<-- size(Loan)  -->|...|<--size(Loan)-->|
///
/// Loans are stored right to left so that it's easy to pop them in order
/// without having to shift all remaining loans in memory.
